# Overview

This C library implements a fair-division algorithm based on Talmudic principles, designed for resolving disputes involving fractional claims. The library is divided into several modules, each handling specific aspects of the dispute resolution process.

## Modules

1. **Fraction:** Handles basic arithmetic and manipulation of fractions.
2. **Claimant:** Manages individual claimants in a dispute, including their claims and collections.
3. **Dispute:** Oversees the overall dispute resolution process, including finding concessions and splitting remainders.
4. **Distribution:** Calculates the distribution of resources among claimants based on their claims.
