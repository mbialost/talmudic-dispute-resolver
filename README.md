# Talmudic Dispute Resolver

## Overview
This repository aims to provide an in-depth exploration of a renowned Fair Division Problem, commonly known as the "Two People Grasping a Garment" scenario (שניים אוחזין בטלית) from the Talmud. It focuses on exploring various algorithmic solutions for dispute resolution, grounded in the concession-based principles outlined in Talmudic law. 

Currently, this repository is in its early development stages. As such, it features only one among several potential solutions for fair division that align with the Talmudic concession-based model. This particular solution was extrapolated from the Talmudic principles by the prominent 18th-century Jewish scholar, Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin, often referred to by the acronym Maharil Diskin (מהרי"ל דיסקין). Maharil Diskin's interpretation, while not formally articulated as a universally applicable algorithm in his writings, provides a compelling example. This includes a detailed rationale at each step and the resulting allocation, illustrated in 'Case 1' within [the documentation](once_upon_a_talit.md) for the fair-division problem.

Currently, the respository is in its initial stages. As a result, it currently implements only one of many possible fair-division solutions that can be viewed as congruent with the Talmudic concession-based approach. This approach was derived from the Talmudic rules by a prominent 18th century Jewish scholar, Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin, often known by the acronym Maharil Diskin (מהרי"ל דיסקין). While not formally defined in his work as a generalizable algorithm, his work does provide an example case, with a rationale at each step, and the final distribution ('Case 1' in [the documentation](once_upon_a_talit.md) for the fair-division problem itself).
