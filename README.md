# Talmudic Dispute Resolver

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to an in-depth exploration of a renowned Fair Division Problem, known as the "Two People Grasping a Garment" scenario (שניים אוחזין בטלית), from the Talmud. It focuses on various algorithmic solutions for dispute resolution, grounded in the concession-based principles of Talmudic law. 

Currently, the repository is in its early development stages. It features one of several potential solutions for fair division that align with the Talmudic concession-based model. This specific solution was extrapolated from the principles by the prominent 18th-century Jewish scholar, Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin, often referred to by his acronym, Maharil Diskin (מהרי"ל דיסקין). Maharil Diskin's interpretation, while not formally articulated as a universally applicable algorithm in his writings, provides a compelling framework. This includes a detailed rationale for each step and the resulting allocation, illustrated in 'Case 1' within [the documentation](once_upon_a_talit.md) for this fair-division problem.
